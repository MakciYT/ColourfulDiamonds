# ColourfulDiamonds
My first mod that adds different types of diamonds and things made from them, the characteristics of which depend on the color of the diamonds. The most valuable diamonds are black, red and green, while the most worthless are brown. Based on the actual characteristics of diamonds of different colors.<br>
Includes black, blue, brown, green, pink, red and yellow colors!

It was created from January 2021 (or December 2020, I donâ€™t remember) to the beginning of February 2021.<br>
To restore it, I had to redo the stupid gradle.
